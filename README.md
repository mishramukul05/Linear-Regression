# Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`, without relying on external machine learning libraries. The dataset was split into a 4:1 ratio for training and validation to ensure proper evaluation. The model was manually developed and evaluated using the `RÂ² score`, achieving nearly 100% accuracy on both the training and validation datasets. Finally, the model was applied to a test dataset, and the predictions were saved as a downloadable CSV file. This repository showcases fundamental concepts of Linear Regression and manual model-building techniques with a focus on transparency and reproducibility.
